# YouTube Popularity Analysis with Kaggle Data

Dive into the intricacies of YouTube channel popularity and its potential relation with a country's economy and location.

## Highlights:

- 📈 **Category Leaders:** "Entertainment" & "Music" reign supreme in subscribers and views.
- 💼 **Economic Insights:** A subtle inverse relation is observed between a nation's unemployment rate and its YouTube channel's popularity. A higher unemployment rate might mean fewer channel activities or subscribers.
- 📊 **Activity ≠ Popularity:** Contrary to popular belief, channel activity (based on video count) doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with its subscriber count.

## Tech Stack: 

- 🐍 Python 
- 📊 pandas, numpy 
- 🎨 seaborn, matplotlib, folium, plotly 
- 🔍 statsmodels
